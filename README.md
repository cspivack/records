# Record Collection

This is a personal project motivated by two things:

- Wanting to learn Svelte/SvelteKit
- Accidentally buying duplicate records at the WFMU Record Fair (twice!) and needing a way to check my collection when I'm out

Data is housed in Airtable, which makes it easy to manage the artist/record relationships and album artwork.

### Roadmap

- ~Add page transitions~
- Implement Airtable attachment ➡️ DigitalOcean Spaces pipeline
- Add missing album artwork
- Find an open-source alternative before Airtable starts to mess with their free tier
