# Record Collection

This is a personal project motivated by two things:

- Wanting to learn Svelte/SvelteKit
- Accidentally buying duplicate records at the WFMU Record Fair (twice!) and needing a way to check my collection when I'm out

Data is housed in Prismic, which makes it easy to manage the artist/record relationships and album artwork.

### Roadmap

- Add missing album artwork
- Update favicon
